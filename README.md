# Learning Path Projects

Welcome to my **Learning Path Projects** repository! ðŸŽ“ This collection includes the projects I developed while exploring programming fundamentals during my Computer Science journey. These projects are designed to serve as resources for anyone looking to understand basic programming concepts and problem-solving techniques.

## Purpose
This repository is a **learning resource** to:
1. Demonstrate how foundational concepts are implemented in C++.
2. Inspire juniors and fellow learners to take their first steps in programming.
3. Showcase the progression of coding skills through practical examples.

## Projects Overview
1. **Base Conversion System**  
   A program to convert numbers between bases like decimal, binary, octal, and hexadecimal.
